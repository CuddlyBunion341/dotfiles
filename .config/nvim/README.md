# Nvim Config

This is my own nvim config. It is strongly opinionated and tailored to my own needs.

## Philosophy

This configuration is a no-nonsense, bare-knuckle beast that prioritizes raw performance and simplicity above all else. It doesn't have time for fancy status lines like `lualine` or bloated file explorers like `Neotree`. No sir, there are no animations or other frivolous distractions that could bog down the editor.

Yes, there are plugins like `gitsigns` that might add a bit of overhead, but nothing that would significantly impact performance. And there's absolutely no room for fancy markdown rendering or over-engineered find and replace tools. It's all about keeping it simple and efficient.

Additionally, the key mappings are kept short and simple. Instead of convoluted mappings like `<leader>cff`, the aim is to limit mappings to one or two keys. This is part of the commitment to efficiency and speed.

The goal here is pure, unadulterated SPEED. Every plugin and setting has been chosen and tweaked with this in mind. If it doesn't make the editing experience faster and more efficient, it doesn't make the cut.

## Overview

I have been using Neovim as my primary editor for a while now and I have been customizing it to my own needs, adding and removing plugins, and tweaking settings to make it more efficient and productive.
The entry point for the configuration is `init.lua`, which loads the rest of the configuration. The configuration is split into some files under the `lua` directory. Lazy plugins can also be found there.

### Repository Files

Here are some of the key files in the repository:

- `./lua/util.lua`: Contains utility functions used across the configuration.
- `./lua/theme.lua`: Contains theme settings and customizations.
- `./lua/settings.lua`: Contains general settings for Neovim.

### Plugins

I am using the lazyvim plugin manager to manage plugins.
[Lazyvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) is a plugin manager that loads plugins lazily, only when they are needed.
